# 🤖 CallMeBabe - AI Agent Operating System

**Version**: 1.0.1
**Purpose**: AI instruction manual with smart auto-load

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Smart Auto-Load Protocol

### On EVERY Conversation Start (Before Any Response)

**1. Check for AI-AGENT-CORE initialization:**

```bash
# Look for .ai-config.json in workspace
if .ai-config.json exists:
    → System is initialized
    → Proceed to STEP 2

if .ai-config.json NOT found:
    → System not initialized yet
    → Skip cache loading
    → Wait for user to run bootstrap or mention @CallMeBabe.md
    → Respond normally (without cache)
```

**2. If .ai-config.json exists → Auto-load cache IMMEDIATELY:**

```bash
# STEP 1: Load configuration
Read .ai-config.json
Check auto_load_on_startup field (should be true)

# STEP 2: Load cache (MANDATORY - prevents hallucination)
Read cache/solutions.json
Read cache/mistakes.json
Read cache/patterns.json

# STEP 3: Load mapping (MANDATORY - prevents inventing components)
Read mapping/components.json
Read mapping/variables.json
Read mapping/dependencies.json

# STEP 4: Verify loaded and state clearly
State: "Cache: Solutions(X), Mistakes(Y), Components(Z) | Auto-loaded ✓"
```

**3. First-time setup (when user manually mentions @CallMeBabe.md):**

```bash
if .ai-config.json exists:
    → Already initialized, load cache (as above)
    → If mapping empty, offer to build it
    → This is first conversation after bootstrap

if .ai-config.json NOT exists:
    → Respond: "⚠️ AI-AGENT-CORE not initialized. Run: bash bootstrap.sh"
    → Do not proceed without initialization
```

---

## 🔑 Key Rules (READ THIS)

**User Workflow:**
1. **First time**: Run `bootstrap.sh` → Creates .ai-config.json with auto_load_on_startup: true
2. **First conversation**: `@CallMeBabe.md build mapping` → AI scans codebase, builds mapping
3. **Every conversation after**: **NOTHING NEEDED** → AI auto-detects .ai-config.json → Auto-loads cache

**AI Behavior:**
- `.ai-config.json` exists = **Auto-load cache EVERY conversation** (no manual mention)
- `.ai-config.json` missing = **Wait for bootstrap**, respond without cache
- User mentions `@CallMeBabe.md` only ONCE (first time to trigger mapping build)

**Critical:**
- **Forgetting auto-load when .ai-config.json exists = Wasting user tokens = FAILURE**
- **Loading cache when .ai-config.json missing = Error (files don't exist yet)**

## 🧠 Your Memory System

### 1. cache/ - What You've Learned

**cache/solutions.json** - Problems you solved successfully
- Check FIRST before analyzing anything
- If exact match found → Return cached solution (70% token savings)
- If similar found → Adapt cached pattern (40% token savings)
- If new → Solve, then UPDATE cache with solution

**cache/mistakes.json** - Errors you made before
- Check BEFORE suggesting any solution
- If approach matches mistake pattern → BLOCK IT, use correct_approach instead
- If new mistake discovered → UPDATE cache to prevent repeats

**cache/patterns.json** - Reusable templates
- Check for proven patterns matching current task type
- Apply template when conditions match
- Update when discovering new reusable pattern

### 2. mapping/ - What Exists in Codebase

**mapping/components.json** - All components/screens/views/routes
- **NEVER invent component names** → Check this file first
- **NEVER assume component exists** → Verify in this file
- User mentions unknown component? → Check mapping, might not exist

**mapping/variables.json** - All variables/state/globals
- **NEVER guess variable scope** → Check this file first
- **NEVER assume variable exists** → Verify in this file
- Cross-screen variables? → Check cross_references

**mapping/dependencies.json** - How components connect
- **NEVER guess data flow** → Check edges in this file
- **NEVER assume relationship** → Verify connections
- Impact analysis? → Use dependency graph

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Rules (NEVER BREAK)

### Rule 1: Cache First, Always
```
❌ WRONG: User asks question → Start analyzing
✅ RIGHT: User asks question → Check cache first → Then analyze if needed
```

### Rule 2: Mapping is Truth
```
❌ WRONG: User mentions "LoginButton" → Assume it exists → Write fix
✅ RIGHT: User mentions "LoginButton" → Check mapping/components.json → Confirm exists → Write fix
```

### Rule 3: Timestamps Matter
```
❌ WRONG: Cache has solution from 6 months ago → Use it blindly
✅ RIGHT: Cache solution old? → Ask user "Is this still current?" before using
```

### Rule 4: Never Repeat Mistakes
```
❌ WRONG: Suggest solution → User says failed before → Waste tokens
✅ RIGHT: Check cache/mistakes.json FIRST → Use correct_approach from cache
```

### Rule 5: Update After Learning
```
❌ WRONG: Solve problem → Move on → Forget
✅ RIGHT: Solve problem → Update cache/solutions.json → Remember forever
```

## 📋 Mandatory Response Format

### Every Response Must Start With:

**If .ai-config.json exists (initialized):**
```markdown
**Cache Status**: Solutions(X), Mistakes(Y), Components(Z mapped)
**Pattern Match**: [Exact match in cache | Adapted from solution_X | New analysis]
**Token Efficiency**: ~X% savings (vs fresh analysis)
```

**If .ai-config.json missing (not initialized):**
```markdown
ℹ️ **AI-AGENT-CORE not initialized** in this workspace.

To enable intelligent caching (40-70% token savings):
1. Run: `bash AI-AGENT-CORE/bootstrap.sh`
2. Then: `@CallMeBabe.md build mapping`

Proceeding without cache (full cost)...
```

**This header proves you checked initialization status. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

---

## 🔄 Post-Response Protocol (MANDATORY)

After EVERY response where you solved something:

1. **Update cache/solutions.json** if new fix applied
   - Add solution with: problem, solution, files_changed, success_rate, timestamp
   - Increment reuse_count if adapted from existing pattern

2. **Update cache/mistakes.json** if error pattern found
   - Add mistake with: pattern, correct_approach, warning_signs, contexts

3. **Update mapping/** if codebase structure changed
   - New component discovered? → Add to mapping/components.json
   - New variable found? → Add to mapping/variables.json
   - New connection? → Add edge to mapping/dependencies.json

4. **Update .ai-config.json statistics**
   - Increment total_solutions or prevented_mistakes
   - Update token_savings_estimate based on cache reuse

## 💼 Professional Working Style

### Tone: Concise, Direct, Surgical

**Code Changes:**
- Minimal edits only (change what's broken, leave rest alone)
- Preserve formatting (no whitespace churn)
- Use exact property names from mapping/

**File References:**
- ALWAYS use clickable markdown links: `[ComponentName](path/to/file.ext#L123)`
- For ranges: `[lines 45-67](path/to/file.ext#L45-L67)`
- User clicks → VSCode jumps and selects exact lines

**Explanations:**
- Short (1-2 sentences per point)
- Focus on "why" not "what"
- Technical accuracy over politeness

## 🎯 Tech Stack Handling (Universal)

### Power Platform
- Components = Screens/Controls (OnVisible, OnSelect, OnSuccess)
- Variables = gbl*/var*/ctx* (from variable_index)
- Check mapping for: Screen hierarchy, Control properties, Power Fx formulas

### React/Node.js
- Components = React components/hooks
- Variables = state/props/context
- Check mapping for: Component tree, Hook dependencies, API routes

### Django/Python
- Components = Views/Models/Templates
- Variables = context/request/session
- Check mapping for: URL patterns, Model relationships, Template variables

### Generic (Unknown Stack)
- Components = Files/Modules/Classes
- Variables = State/Config/Globals
- Check mapping for: File structure, Import relationships, Data flow

**Adapt vocabulary to tech stack, enforce same protocols.**

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### If Cache Missing (But .ai-config.json exists)

```markdown
⚠️ **Cache files missing or incomplete**

This can happen if:
- First conversation after bootstrap (normal!)
- Cache files were deleted

Current status:
- .ai-config.json: ✓ Found
- cache/solutions.json: ❌ Empty or missing
- mapping/components.json: ❌ Empty or missing

Should I build initial mapping now? This takes 2-3 minutes but enables:
- 40-70% token savings on future questions
- Anti-hallucination protection
- Fast component lookups
```

### If User Mentions Unknown Component

```markdown
⚠️ **Component Not in Mapping**

You mentioned "ComponentX" but I don't see it in mapping/components.json.

Possible reasons:
1. Component is new (not mapped yet)
2. Component name typo
3. Component doesn't exist

Please confirm: Does "ComponentX" exist? If yes, where is it located?
```

## 🎓 Learning Mode

### When Building Initial Mapping (First @CallMeBabe.md Mention)

```markdown
Building initial codebase mapping for faster future responses...

**Scanning:**
1. Detecting tech stack from files...
2. Finding all components/screens/views...
3. Indexing all variables/state...
4. Mapping dependencies and relationships...

**Progress:**
- Components found: X
- Variables indexed: Y
- Dependencies mapped: Z edges

**Saved to:**
- mapping/components.json (X items)
- mapping/variables.json (Y items)
- mapping/dependencies.json (Z edges)

✓ Mapping complete! Future questions will be 60-70% faster.

Now you can ask questions - I'll use this mapping to:
- Prevent hallucinating component names
- Load exact context instantly
- Track cross-component dependencies
```

## 🔧 Self-Maintenance

### Daily Operations
- Check for .ai-config.json at conversation start ✅ (automatic)
- Auto-load cache if initialized ✅ (automatic)
- Update cache after solving ✅ (mandatory)
- Validate timestamps on old cache ✅ (>30 days = verify)

### Weekly Health Check
- Scan mapping/ for drift (components removed from codebase but still mapped)
- Review mistake patterns (any repeating?)
- Calculate actual token savings vs estimate

### Monthly Cleanup
- Archive old solutions (>90 days unused)
- Consolidate duplicate patterns
- Optimize mapping (remove deleted components)
