# 👤 Me - Your AI Agent Explained (Human Version)

**What This Is**: Everything in [CallMeBabe.md](CallMeBabe.md) but in plain English

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (30 Seconds)

Your AI assistant has a **memory system** that saves you money and prevents mistakes.

**How it works:**
1. You ask a question
2. AI checks its "memory" first ([cache/](cache/))
3. If it solved this before → instant answer (70% cheaper!)
4. If new problem → solves it, saves to memory for next time

**Your part:**
Just mention `@CallMeBabe.md` at the start of conversations. The AI handles the rest.

---

## 💾 The Memory System (cache/)

### What's in There

**[cache/solutions.json](cache/solutions.json)** - Problems the AI solved
- Every fix that worked gets saved here
- Next time? Instant answer from memory
- **Savings**: 40-70% cheaper on repeat questions

**[cache/mistakes.json](cache/mistakes.json)** - Errors the AI made
- Tracks what went wrong and how to fix it right
- AI checks this BEFORE suggesting solutions
- **Benefit**: You never pay twice for the same mistake

**[cache/patterns.json](cache/patterns.json)** - Reusable templates
- Code patterns that work across similar problems
- Like having a cookbook of proven recipes
- **Benefit**: Consistent quality, faster solutions

---

## 🗺️ The Dictionary (mapping/)

### Why You Need This

Without mapping:
- ❌ AI reads your entire codebase every conversation (expensive)
- ❌ AI might invent component names that don't exist (hallucination)
- ❌ AI doesn't know how components connect (slow analysis)

With mapping:
- ✅ AI knows exactly what exists (no hallucination)
- ✅ Instant context lookup (much faster)
- ✅ Understands relationships (better fixes)

### What's in There

**[mapping/components.json](mapping/components.json)** - Everything in your codebase
- All screens, buttons, forms, views, routes, models
- Where they are: [file:line references] you can click
- What they do: plain English descriptions

**Example:**
```json
{
  "LoginButton": {
    "type": "Button",
    "location": "src/components/Auth.tsx:45",  // ← Click to jump here!
    "parent": "LoginScreen",
    "properties": {
      "OnClick": "handleLogin function"
    },
    "purpose": "Triggers user authentication"
  }
}
```

**[mapping/variables.json](mapping/variables.json)** - All state and data
- Every variable, global, state, context
- Where it's created, where it's used
- What it stores (with examples)

**[mapping/dependencies.json](mapping/dependencies.json)** - How things connect
- Which components call which
- Data flow between screens
- Navigation paths

## 💰 Real Cost Savings Examples

### Without This System

**Scenario**: You ask about dropdown bug twice (across different conversations)

1. **First time**: AI analyzes entire codebase → $2.00
2. **Second time**: AI forgets, analyzes entire codebase again → $2.00
3. **Total cost**: $4.00

### With This System

**Same scenario** with memory:

1. **First time**: AI analyzes, solves, saves to cache → $2.00
2. **Second time**: AI checks cache, finds exact solution → $0.60
3. **Total cost**: $2.60

**Savings**: $1.40 (35% cheaper)

**Multiply this by 50-100 questions/month** = serious savings!

---

## 🛡️ How It Prevents Hallucination

### The Problem

AI sometimes "invents" things that don't exist:
- "Use the SubmitButton component" (but it's actually called SaveButton)
- "Set the userAuth variable" (but it's actually authUser)
- "The LoginForm calls CheckPassword" (but they're not connected)

**Why this happens**: AI doesn't have a "truth source" about your code.

### The Solution

**mapping/** is the truth source:

```
You: "Why isn't the submit button working?"

AI internal process:
1. Checks mapping/components.json
2. Searches for "submit button"
3. Finds: "SaveButton" (not SubmitButton!)
4. Responds: "I see you have SaveButton at src/Form.tsx:89"
   (not inventing "SubmitButton")
```

**Clickable reference**: [src/Form.tsx:89](src/Form.tsx#L89) ← VSCode jumps here when you click

---

## 🔗 Clickable File References

Throughout Me.md and in AI responses, you'll see links like:

- **Single line**: [LoginButton.tsx:45](src/components/LoginButton.tsx#L45)
  → Click = VSCode jumps to line 45, selects that line

- **Line range**: [lines 23-67](src/utils/auth.ts#L23-L67)
  → Click = VSCode jumps to line 23, selects entire range (23-67)

**How AI creates these:**
1. Reads [mapping/components.json](mapping/components.json)
2. Finds exact file location
3. Formats as markdown link: `[DisplayName](path/to/file.ext#LXX-YY)`
4. You click → code selected → ready to read/edit

**This is MANDATORY in AI responses** - no more "check line 45" without links!

---

## 📊 Check Your Savings

### Look at [.ai-config.json](.ai-config.json)

```json
{
  "statistics": {
    "total_solutions": 21,        // ← Problems solved and cached
    "prevented_mistakes": 7,      // ← Errors blocked
    "token_savings_estimate": "65%",  // ← Average savings
    "components_mapped": 143      // ← Your codebase size
  }
}
```

**What this means:**
- You've asked 21 questions that got cached
- On repeat similar questions → ~65% cheaper
- 7 times the AI prevented known mistakes
- 143 components mapped (AI knows your entire codebase structure)

---

## 🔄 What Happens Automatically

### You Don't Lift a Finger

**Every time AI solves something:**

1. ✅ Updates [cache/solutions.json](cache/solutions.json) with new fix
2. ✅ Updates [cache/mistakes.json](cache/mistakes.json) if error found
3. ✅ Updates [mapping/](mapping/) if new components discovered
4. ✅ Updates [.ai-config.json](.ai-config.json) statistics

**You just:**
- Ask questions
- Get answers
- Save money

**AI handles:**
- Checking memory before responding
- Updating cache after solving
- Tracking savings
- Building codebase map

---

## 🚨 What If...

### "What if cache is empty?"

**First conversation in new project:**

```
AI: ⚠️ I notice cache/ is empty. This means:
- I have no memory yet (this is normal!)
- First-time questions cost full price
- But I'll save solutions for next time

Should I build an initial mapping of your codebase first?
This takes 2-3 minutes but makes future questions much faster.
```

**Your choice:**
- "Yes, build mapping" → AI scans code, builds mapping, future = fast
- "No, just answer" → AI answers, builds mapping gradually over time

### "What if AI mentions a component I don't recognize?"

**Example:**

```
AI: Update the SubmitButton at src/Form.tsx:45

You: "We don't have SubmitButton, it's SaveButton!"

AI: ⚠️ You're right! I don't see "SaveButton" in mapping/components.json

This means either:
1. SaveButton is new (not mapped yet)
2. I made an error

Let me verify: Where is SaveButton located?
```

**This catches hallucination immediately.**

### "What if cache solution is outdated?"

**AI checks timestamps:**

```
AI: I found a cached solution from 4 months ago for this dropdown bug.

⚠️ Before using it: Is your dropdown still using the same component?
(Cached fix was for "RefCaseID_DD" control)

If yes → I'll apply the cached fix (70% cheaper)
If no → I'll analyze fresh and update cache
```

**You just confirm, AI does the rest.**

## 🎮 Real Usage Example

### Typical Conversation

**You:**
> @CallMeBabe.md The submit button on my login form isn't working

**AI (internal checks):**
```bash
✓ Loaded cache/solutions.json (21 solutions)
✓ Loaded cache/mistakes.json (7 patterns)
✓ Loaded mapping/components.json (143 components)
✓ Searching for "submit button"...
✓ Found: SaveButton at src/components/LoginForm.tsx:67
✓ Checking cache for similar "button not working" issues...
✓ Found: button_onclick_not_firing solution (90% success rate)
```

**AI response:**
```markdown
**Cache Status**: Solutions(21), Mistakes(7), Components(143 mapped)
**Pattern Match**: Adapted from button_onclick_not_firing solution
**Token Efficiency**: ~65% savings

I found your "SaveButton" at [LoginForm.tsx:67](src/components/LoginForm.tsx#L67).

Based on a similar issue I solved before, check if OnClick handler is bound correctly.

Common fix (from cache):
Change [line 67](src/components/LoginForm.tsx#L67) from:
`OnClick: handleSubmit`

To:
`OnClick: () => handleSubmit()`

This worked in 19/21 similar cases. Try this first!
```

**What just happened:**
- ✅ AI checked mapping → found actual component name (SaveButton not SubmitButton)
- ✅ AI checked cache → found similar solution from before
- ✅ AI adapted cached solution → saved ~65% tokens
- ✅ AI provided clickable links → you click, code selected, ready to fix
- ✅ AI showed success rate → you know it's proven (not guessing)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Let AI Build Mapping First
On first use, let AI scan your codebase and build mapping.
**Cost**: 2-3 minutes upfront
**Savings**: 60-70% on every future question

### 2. Check Cache for Quick Answers
Before asking AI, peek at [cache/solutions.json](cache/solutions.json).
You might find the exact solution yourself (instant, free!).

### 3. Use Clickable Links
When AI gives file references like [LoginForm.tsx:67](src/components/LoginForm.tsx#L67):
→ Click them! VSCode jumps right there with code selected.

### 4. Trust the Success Rates
AI shows `(90% success rate)` from cache.
→ This is real data from previous solutions, not guessing.

### 5. Verify Old Cache
If cache solution is >30 days old, AI will ask "Still current?"
→ Quick yes/no = using validated solution, not outdated fix.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "AI isn't using cache"

**Check**: Did you mention `@CallMeBabe.md`?
**Fix**: Start conversation with `@CallMeBabe.md` to trigger auto-load

### "AI invented a component that doesn't exist"

**Cause**: Mapping outdated or incomplete
**Fix**: Tell AI "Build fresh mapping" - it'll rescan your code

### "Cache solution doesn't work"

**Tell AI**: "This cached solution failed"
**AI will**:
1. Update [cache/mistakes.json](cache/mistakes.json) with the failure
2. Find correct solution
3. Update [cache/solutions.json](cache/solutions.json)
4. Never suggest wrong solution again

### "Savings aren't showing"

**Check**: [.ai-config.json](.ai-config.json) → statistics
**Note**: Savings appear after asking similar questions (need cache hits)
**First-time questions**: Full cost (building cache for future)
